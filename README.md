# Google_data_analytics_capstone_project
This is my case-study / capstone project which I completed as part of the google data analytics certificate provided by coursera
Overview

why I decided to take the google data analytics certificate:

My decision to take the google data analytics certificate was made as a way to give me an insight into what data analytics really was, id heard about data analytics and felt it could be a career path which I would enjoy, however I had no first-hand experience with the industry. Id previously enjoyed using programming languages such as python and spreadsheet software as well as finding enjoyment and greater understanding of topics when coming across relevant and well made data visualisations. however remaining unsure wether data analytics was the correct career path for me, I decided I needed to take my time and gain a greater understanding of what tasks, responsibilities, and activity a data analyst would be involved with on a day to day basis. After some research I came across the google data analytics certificate, and decided to enrol. 

My feelings about the course: 

Overall I am very pleased with what I have gained from the course, it certainly has given me a greater understanding of the world of data analytics and has convinced me that data analytics is the correct career path for me to pursue. i would say the strength of the course lies in outlining the mindset, theory and process of data analytics. The main benefit I believe I have gained from the course is a clear concept of what it means to be a data analyst, which is exactly what I was looking for when I enrolled. However I did find the course was lacking in its teaching of the skills I will need to work productively as a data analyst, only lightly covering software such as tableau, sql and R. Despite this I would recommend the course to anyone who doesnâ€™t have experience in the industry and is trying to make the decision whether or not to pursue a career in data analytics. I have found that the course has left me keenly looking to take the next steps with my studying of analytical skills and begin working as a data analyst.
